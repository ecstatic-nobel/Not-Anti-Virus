# [Not Anti-Virus (Not AV)â„¢]  
##### An attmept to block malware before AV scans it.  

#### Description  
Not all things are seen as equal until you stare at it long enough!  

With malware causing havoc across the globe, this browser extension is a PoC for blocking malware downloads using just the response headers. The research for Emotet can be found in this thread: https://twitter.com/ecstatic_nobel/status/1176267975537713152?s=19.   

#### Demonstration blocking Mozi:  
- Connect to URLhaus  
- Open three (3) database entries for recent and active Mozi URLs that end with "Mozi.m"  
- Hightlight and open the URL in a new tab  
- Not AV detects it, file download is blocked, and the browser is redirected to 127.0.0.1  

#### Demonstration blocking GuLoader:  
- Connect to URLhaus  
- Open three (3) database entries for recent and active GuLoader URLs that contain the word "encrypted"  
- Hightlight and open the URL in a new tab  
- Not AV detects it, file download is blocked, and the browser is redirected to 127.0.0.1  

#### Demonstration blocking Emotet:  
- Connect to URLhaus  
- Open three (3) database entries for recent and active Emotet URLs  
- Hightlight and open the URL in a new tab  
- Not AV detects it, file download is blocked, and the browser is redirected to 127.0.0.1  

>NOTE: Out of the box, this will block the majority of:
>  - GuLoader malware that contains the word "encrypted"
>  - Emotet (or other file download) that has a cookie name built with the PHP uniqid function (or something similar) in the Set-Cookie header
>
>This PoC can be strengthened by adding other indicators found in the response (or request) headers to avoid false-positives.
