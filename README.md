# [Not Anti-Virus (Not AV)â„¢]  
##### An attmept to block malware before AV scans it.  

#### Description  
Not all things are seen as equal until you stare at it long enough!  

With malware causing havoc across the globe, this unreleased project attempts to block malicious file downloads with no need for file reputation and it currently does this very well with #Emotet.  

#### Demonstration blocking Emotet:  
- Connect to URLhaus  
- Open three (3) database entries for recent and active Emotet URLs  
- Hightlight and open the URL in a new tab  
- Not AV detects it, file download is blocked, and the browser is redirected to 127.0.0.1
