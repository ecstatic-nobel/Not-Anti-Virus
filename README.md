# [Not Anti-Virus (Not AV)â„¢]  
##### An attmept to block malware before AV scans it.  

#### Description  
Not all things are seen as equal until you stare at it long enough!  

With malware causing havoc across the globe, this project attempts to block malicious downloads before host-level anti-virus gets a hold of it. It currently happens to do this very well with Emotet.  

Want a live demonstration? Need help setting this up in your environment? See my contact below.  

#### Demonstration blocking Emotet:  
- Connect to URLhaus  
- Open three (3) database entries for recent and active Emotet URLs  
- Hightlight and open the URL in a new tab  
- Not AV detects it, file download is blocked, and the browser is redirected to 127.0.0.1
